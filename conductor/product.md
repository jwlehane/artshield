# Initial Concept
A local-first, privacy-focused tool for independent artists to protect their work from non-consensual AI training.

# ArtShield

## Product Vision
ArtShield aims to democratize defense for artists in the age of AI. It provides a comprehensive, robust, and multifaceted online art, digital, and legal protection scheme. By integrating technical shields with legal and procedural safeguards, ArtShield restores agency to creators and ensures their work is respected in the digital landscape.

## Target Audience
- Independent digital artists and illustrators seeking to protect their creative output from unauthorized exploitation.

## Primary Goals
- **Comprehensive Protection:** Guide artists through a robust multifaceted process including technical and legal safeguards.
- **Local-First with Options:** Default to local processing for absolute privacy and data ownership, while offering optional cloud-based processing for accessibility.
- **Multilayered Defense:** Implement watermarks, anti-AI poisoning (adversarial perturbations), down-sampling, metadata management, and legal declarations (robots.txt, copyright notices).
- **Anti-Copying/Remixing:** Provide protections against human copying (cutting/pasting) and unauthorized remixing.

## Key Features
- **Automated Shielding & Watermarking:** Integration of anti-AI poisoning techniques and invisible watermarking to deter scraping and training.
- **Hybrid Processing Engine:** High-performance local processing for privacy, with a secure online processing option for users with limited hardware.
- **Legal Protection Toolkit:** Automated generation of `robots.txt` files, AI-opt-out metadata, and standardized copyright language.
- **Local Batch Processing:** Efficient tools for processing entire folders of artwork, including down-sampling and metadata stripping.
- **Web Deployment Assets:** Protective language and configuration files ready for deployment on artist websites.

## Success Metrics
- **Assets Protected:** Total number of image files and creative assets processed and shielded by the tool.
- **Deployment Footprint:** The number of users and websites successfully deploying ArtShield's protective language and configuration files.
