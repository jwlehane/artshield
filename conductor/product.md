# Initial Concept
ArtShield is a local-first, privacy-focused tool for independent artists to protect their work from non-consensual AI training.

# Product Guide: ArtShield

## 1. Vision & Purpose
ArtShield is the "Signal" of image protection—a "One-Click Shield" designed to restore agency to creators. We empower artists to navigate the age of AI by providing tools that enforce consent, ensure privacy, and enable safe online marketing of their creative work.

## 2. Target Audience
- **Independent Digital Artists & Illustrators:** Protecting unique styles from mimicry.
- **Professional Photographers & Studios:** Safeguarding high-value visual assets.
- **Analog Artists:** Protecting digital representations of physical work shared online for marketing.

## 3. Core Goals & Values
- **Consent as a Standard:** Restoring the artist's right to decide if their work updates an AI model.
- **Accessibility:** Making sophisticated adversarial research (Mist v2, Glaze, Nightshade) simple enough for non-technical users.
- **Total Protection:** Defending against both AI scraping for training and traditional duplication/theft.
- **Safety & Trust:** Maintaining an open-source, local-only codebase that users can audit and trust.

## 4. Key Features
- **The Cloak (Style Protection):** "Glaze-style" cloaking to disrupt AI style mimicry, preventing models from learning an artist's unique look.
- **The Poison (Model Defense):** "Nightshade-style" data poisoning to actively disrupt image generation models if scraped without consent.
- **The Tag (Metadata):** Comprehensive metadata injection including `NoAI` signals, copyright assertions, and explicit ownership/contact information.
- **The Stamp (Watermark):** Elegant visual watermarking for secure social media display.
- **Resolution Guard:** Automatic down-sampling (down-res) of images to screen-friendly resolutions that are insufficient for high-quality printing, preventing physical theft.
- **Legal Resource Kit:** A collection of legal language and templates artists can add to their websites to legally fortify their "Do Not Train" stance.

## 5. Success Metrics (6-Month Horizon)
- **Community Adoption:** Significant milestone in downloads and active daily usage among independent artists.
- **Trusted Authority:** Frequent social media mentions as the go-to trusted tool for protection.

## 6. Long-Term Vision
- **Industry Standard:** Establishing ArtShield as the primary standard for artist-led AI opt-out systems.
- **Multi-Media Support:** Expanding protection capabilities to video, 3D models, and audio.
