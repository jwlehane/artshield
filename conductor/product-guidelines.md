# ArtShield Product Guidelines

## Tone and Voice
- **Friendly & Accessible:** ArtShield speaks to artists in a way that is simple and approachable. We avoid gatekeeping with complex jargon, ensuring that powerful security tools feel welcoming to creators of all technical backgrounds.
- **Supportive & Encouraging:** We act as a partner in the artist's defensive strategy, providing clear guidance without being alarmist.

## Communication Strategy
- **Visual Analogies:** Complex technical concepts (like adversarial poisoning or metadata stripping) should be explained using physical metaphors familiar to artists. For example, "adding noise is like putting a frosted glass over your painting—clear to humans, but confusing to scanners."
- **Layered Information:** Provide the essential "how-to" upfront, while keeping deep technical "why" details accessible but secondary for those who wish to learn more.

## Visual Aesthetic
- **Clean & Minimalist "Studio" Design:** The interface should feel like a professional creative tool—clutter-free, focused, and high-contrast.
- **Theme Support:** Both Light and Dark "Studio" modes should be supported to match the artist's preferred working environment.
- **Clarity Over Ornamentation:** Use icons and layout to emphasize workflow efficiency and the status of protected assets.

## User Experience Principles
- **One-Click Confidence:** Strive for "one-click" actions for common tasks, providing immediate visual feedback when an asset is "Shielded."
- **Transparency:** Clearly indicate which protections are being applied and whether processing is happening locally or via the optional cloud engine.
